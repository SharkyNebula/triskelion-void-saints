**Triskelion: Void Saints** is my TC for Endless Sky that recreates the Novaverse. It's main features are:
1) incorporating the whole breadth of Supernova Shipyard content through Endless Sky's variant system. The stats for the new ships have been designed by spreadsheet using a combination of that ship's assigned size, perks and faction.
2) remaking Nova's map to focus on trade loops. Most planets should have a trade good that they produce and one they demand, to encourage through and profitable exploration and travelling of the universe.

## Installing
1) Download the [ES Launcher](https://github.com/EndlessSkyCommunity/ESLauncher2) and use that to download continuous ES. Download buttons for various OSes are found in that page's Readme, just scroll down.
3) Clone/download triskelion-void-saints. To do this, scroll up and click the green 'code' button to find a 'download .zip' option.
4) Copy the .dll and .exe files from continuous ES into endless-sky triskelion's folder.
