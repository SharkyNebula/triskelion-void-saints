**ES:EVENT** is an acronym that stands for **E**ndless **S**ky: **E**scape **V**elocity **E**nhanced **N**ova **T**riskelion. EVENT is my TC for Endless Sky that recreates the Novaverse. It's main features are
1) incorporating the whole breadth of Supernova Shipyard content through Endless Sky's variant system. The stats for the new ships have been designed by spreadsheet using a combination of that ship's assigned size, perks and faction.
2) remaking Nova's map to focus on trade loops. Most planets should have a trade good that they produce and one they demand, to encourage through and profitable exploration and travelling of the universe.

## Installing
1) Download the [ES Launcher](https://github.com/EndlessSkyCommunity/ESLauncher2) and use that to download continuous ES
2) Delete the data, images and sound folder from continuous ES
3) Clone/download endless-sky triskelion
4) Move everything remaining from continuous ES into endless-sky triskelion's folder
